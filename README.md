# Adaptive Modeling Against Adversarial Attacks (Fast FGSM Experiment)

This is the official experiment repo on Fast-FGSM base models for the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.12431) "Adaptive Modeling Against Adversarial Attacks".

The main code repo: https://github.com/JokerYan/post_training
The Madry Model experiment repo: https://github.com/JokerYan/pytorch-adversarial-training.git 

* Please note that the algorithm might be referred as **post training** for easy reference.

# Envrionment Setups
We recommend using Anaconda to setup the envrionment, with the following command:
```bash
conda env create -f pt_env.yml
conda activate post_train
```
